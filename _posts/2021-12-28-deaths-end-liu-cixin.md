*WARNING might contain spoilers*

The third and final installment in the *Remembrance of Earth's Past* trilogy. Where the first one - The Three Body
Problem - was still rather straight forward scifi with an orient perspective, the next two press on the hard scifi
button harder and the deep end gets deeper. This one picked up where the second book left off. Again my inherent
~~racism~~ unfamiliarity with Chinese names got the best of me - I got lost multiple times on the characters. Xe? Ji?
Li? But the book was certainly long enough to get you back on track. The symbolism used (sword bearers etc.) was still
rather foreign but it made it all the more interesting.

The scifi certainly gets awesomely bat shit crazy in the end, which was to be expected. Dimensions come and go, millions
of years are jumped.

4/5.
