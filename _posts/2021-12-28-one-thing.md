[A.J. Jacobs in Econtalk](https://www.econtalk.org/a-j-jacobs-on-thanks-a-thousand/) notes that we remember nothing from
most stuff we read or otherwise consume some time later. I certainly experience this as much as anyone - even books I
enjoyed quite a bit I can't recall anything. I thought I'd attempt to write down at least one thing from at least the
books I read. Or rather listen to mostly. But anything and everything goes on this series.
