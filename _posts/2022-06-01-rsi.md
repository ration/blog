Now that I'm well passed the magical 40yo mark I've noticed my fingers aren't as invincible as they used to be. I get
random RSI strain in mu fingers and especially in my thumbs. Likely a lot from phone usage though, but I've noticed my
keyboard habits also have a big impact. I'm not convinced that "ergonomic" keyboards that remove weird angles are a
permanent solution - a permanent solution would be to not use keyboards.  While I do have an ergonomic keyboard - many
in fact - and they do help, it's more helpful to rotate them just to remove the repetition. My current setup is rotation [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard v2](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/product/uhk60v2), [Logitech K860](https://www.logitech.com/fi-fi/products/keyboards/k860-split-ergonomic.html) and a [Topre Realforce (TKL)](https://www.realforcekeyboards.com/uk/).

What also helps is - weirdly enough - typing. More specifically typing text that you don't normally type which in my case is prose. My current
go-to is [typelit.io](https://www.typelit.io/) which allows you to type classic literature. Heck I've read many books practicing typing with it!
