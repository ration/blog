[This episode](https://www.econtalk.org/lorne-buchman-on-creativity-leadership-and-art/) discussed the eternal struggle
on how to be creative. One of the main points is that many successful creators say that they "follow the characters with
they pen" and "just writing" instead of waiting for inspiration. Exploring by creating _something_ and stumbling upon
the ideas. That discovery of novel ideas is very hard or impossible to control. Stephen King comes to mind who talks a
lot about writing his books this way.

On the "just the follow the characters" method my biggest worry is the endings, which they did get into albeit very
briefly. Many authors that write this way write excellent characters with compelling beginnings only to have the story
fall flat in the end. Case in point King or Lost (JJ. Abrams) mentioned in the podcast. For Abrams this is especially
flagrantly evident in his [Mystery Box TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/j_j_abrams_the_mystery_box). Nice idea, just
expect to be disappointed in the end.
