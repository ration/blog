Just to prove the power of one thing idea - I had no memory of this until I read my notes...

This [Econtalk episode](https://www.econtalk.org/frank-rose-on-internet-narratives/) was again rather non economic which is find. Here are my
On telling compelling stories:
> People don't care about what you do, they care why you do it. It's what differentiates you from everybody else.

This is always something I will try to keep in mind when making things like presentations. Don't try to squeeze out the
human from your ideas. People can get the facts in seconds if they wish, but to make them stick they need to be compelling.

Second one as a reminder from Kahnemann:
> From most experiences we remember the peak moment and the end.

While a bit contested research, I like to think this is also something nice to keep in mind. Actually have a peak moment
and think about a proper ending.
